= pool_party

Simple thread pool with a few advanced features.

== Features

  * execution state querying
  * timeouts and configurable timeout implementation
  * graceful error handling
  * unit tests

== Example

  pool = PoolParty.new :size => 2
  pool.execute{ sleep(0.01); "a" }
  pool.execute{ sleep(0.01); "b" }
  pool.execute{ sleep(0.01); "c" }
  pool.join # Should return in about 0.02 seconds... ;)
  pool.values # ["a", "b", "c"]

== Execution state

You can query the state of an execution.

  pool = PoolParty.new :size => 2
  execution = pool.execute{ sleep(0.01); "a" }
  pool.execute{ sleep(0.01); "b" }
  pool.execute{ sleep(0.01); "c" }
  pool.join
  execution.started?   # true
  execution.finished?  # true
  execution.timed_out? # false
  execution.duration   # ~0.01
  execution.value      # "a"

== Timeouts

You can restrict how long executions are allowed to run for.

  pool = PoolParty.new :size => 2, :timeout => 0.02, :default_value => "failed"
  pool.execute{ sleep(0.01); "a" }
  pool.execute{ sleep(0.03); "b" }
  pool.execute{ sleep(0.01); "c" }
  pool.join
  pool.executions[1].started?   # true
  pool.executions[1].finished?  # true
  pool.executions[1].timed_out? # true
  pool.executions[1].duration   # ~0.02
  pool.executions[1].value      # "failed"

== Error handling

If an execution causes an exception, it will be reraised when PoolParty#join (or any other method that calls PoolParty#join) is called, unless you pass <tt>:reraise => false</tt> to PoolParty#new.  The exception is stored in PoolParty::Execution#exception.

  pool = PoolParty.new :size => 2, :reraise => false, :default_value => "failure"
  execution = pool.execute{ raise("busted"); "a" }
  pool.join
  execution.value # "failure"
  execution.exception # RuntimeError: busted

== Joining vs shutting down

PoolParty#join blocks until all pending executions are done running.  It does not actually kill the pool party's worker threads (incase you want to do more work).  PoolParty#shutdown actually kills the worker threads.

Sometimes it can be a pain to remember to call #shutdown, so as a convenience, you can pass a block to PoolParty#new and #join and #shutdown will be called for you.

  party = PoolParty.new do |p|
    p.execute{ "a" }
    p.execute{ "b" }
    p.execute{ "c" }
  end
  # At this point, #join and #shutdown have been called.
  party.values # ["a", "b", "c"]

== Configurable timeout method

<tt>Timeout.timeout</tt> is unreliable in MRI 1.8.x.  To address this, you can have PoolParty use an alternative implementation.

 require "system_timer"
 party = PoolParty.new :timeout_method => SystemTimer.method(:timeout) do
   ...
 end
 
The <tt>:timeout_method</tt> option takes any callable object (i.e. <tt>responds_to?(:call)</tt>) that implements something similar to <tt>Timeout.timeout</tt> (i.e. takes the same arguments and raises <tt>Timeout::Error</tt>).

  require "system_timer"
  party = PoolParty.new :timeout_method => Proc.new{ |seconds, &block| SystemTimer.timeout(seconds, &block) }
    ...
  end
