  #   :timeout_method => An object that implements something like Timeout.timeout via #call.  Default is Timeout.method(:timeout).
  #   :default_value => Value of an execution if it times out or errors.  Default is nil.
  #   :reraise => True if you want exceptions reraised when ThreadStorm#join is called.  Default is true.
  #   :execute_blocks => True if you want #execute to block until there is an available thread.  Default is false.
