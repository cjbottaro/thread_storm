  # This is tricky... we need to maintain both real queue size and fake queue size.
  # If we use just the real queue size alone, then we will see the following
  # (incorrect) behavior:
  #   storm = ThreadStorm.new :size => 2, :execute_blocks => true
  #   storm.execute{ sleep }
  #   storm.execute{ sleep }
  #   storm.execute{ sleep } # Doesn't block, but should.
  #   storm.execute{ sleep } # Finally blocks.
  # The reason is that popping the queue (and thus decrementing its size) does not
  # imply that the worker thread has actually finished the execution and is ready to
  # accept another one.
